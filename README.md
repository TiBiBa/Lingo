# Lingo
Welcome! To the first voice-based Lingo game. The classical Dutch TV game in which two teams battle to guess the most 5-letter words and win the most money. This game is completely voice-supported making it a must-have for a game night! It runs on a `Flask` server, supported by `Tailwind` and the `SpeechRecognition` library. Found any issues? Let me know!
